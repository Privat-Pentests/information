# New feature request

### New Feature
If you want to add a new feature, please create a new issue with the label `feature` in the associated repository beforehand. 
There you explain what you want to implement and in what form. If you receive positive feedback from a [member of the private pentests organization](https://github.com/orgs/Privat-Pentests/people), you can implement this. 
To do this, you simply fork the repository and program it in or around what you described in the issue. 
When you are done you test your feature and then open a pull request in the original repository.

### Bug fix
If you have found a bug, please create a new issue with the label `bug` and describe how the bug occurred and what it is about. 
Then the bug will be tested by a [member of the private pentests organization](https://github.com/orgs/Privat-Pentests/people).
If you then receive positive feedback, you can view this bug as a feature and work through the points mentioned in the previous paragraph.

If you haven't found a bug but still want to fix one, you can look in the issues of a repository to see if there are any issues with the label `bug`. 
If these bugs have been confirmed and nobody has reported that they want to fix this bug, you can report the issue and then fix the bug as in the upper paragraph.
